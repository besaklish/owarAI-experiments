# Components

## Base components

Base components...

- can be used as the base component for more specific components
- can be used by themselves for simple use cases

### Naming

The base components' name look like `OeXXX`.

`Oe` stands for "owarAI experiments" which is the name of this project.

### Styles

The style should be funny and joke, but do not do it too much.

For example, the border radius should be too rounded, but not too much.
